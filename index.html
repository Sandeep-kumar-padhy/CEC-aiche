          <p> Chem-E-Car is a hitherto small-scale vehicle that is wholly powered by chemical
            reactions. There is an annual Chem-E-Car competition organized by AIChE for
            students from different chapters to compete to compete their respective cars againts
            one another in a controlled and manipulated environment. Chem-E-Car basically
            needs a starting or powering reaction, circuitry for control and finally a stopping
            reaction. We can also add some more controls and a little intelligence to our car by
            adding a microprocessor like Arduino. More of these shall be covered in the
             sections.

        <h4>Starting Reaction:</h4>
        <p>This team takes care about the starting reaction to be used in the Chem-E-Car.
          Starting reaction, as the name suggests, starts the car but it is responsible for
          powering the car until it finally stops. So, it is basically a chemical cell. So far, we
          have tried out various chemical reactions and cells to power the vehicle. Last year,
          we tried out two different cells in two of our different cars, namely thermo peltier
          cell and Al air cell. The team has to test out the proposed cell in multiple conditions
          and proportions of chemical used so that it truly stands out in all conditions.

        <h4>Electronics:</h4>
        <p> The circuit team plays a vital role as it sets up the control of the car, starting from
          the motors attached with the wheels to LDR that makes the motor stop when the
          stopping reaction finally happens. This is not all. They are also encased with
          making the circuits as uncomplicated and less power-consuming as possible. It also
          designs and embeds the sensor system which makes the car function in the required
          way in the specified time.

        <h4>Design:</h4>
        <p>  The mechanics team is entitled with the responsibility of making the car robust and
          design the whole mechanical structure, They decide the position of all the elements
          of the car starting from the chassis to the wheels and also the quality and size of the
          elements. The plan group must consolidate and organize the reactor, control source,
          microcontrollers and wiring into the car, so that it behaves in the desired way.

        <h4>Stopping Reaction:</h4>
        <p>
          Stopping reaction marks the end of the car’s journey. This is facilitated by the
          stopping reaction team which decides upon a proper reaction which can incorporate
          a final stopping of the car in the smoothest way possible. The team prototypes the
          reaction for various proportions and manipulates the time of the reaction so that it
          matches the requirements of the competition. The required time, load and distance
          are provided right before the competition. So, the team has to be prepared for all the
          different requirements.
